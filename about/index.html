    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <!-- TODO I should specify what kind of team I work on in NI and I should play up more of my interests -->
    <p>
        I am a Software Engineer residing in Austin, TX. I recently graduated from <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/" target="_blank">Texas A&amp;M University</a>
        and work as a Full Stack Developer at <a href="http://www.ni.com/en-us.html" target="_blank">National Instruments</a>. I've written web front-ends using Javascript, HTML5, and CSS and I've also written the server code to go with in either Python or Node.js.
        At National Instruments I've had the chance to write driver code and make changes to the Linux Kernel itself. I'm constantly learning new things and getting outside of my comfy CS expertise area.
        I feel like I'm starting to perfect the art of asking people who know way more than me enough to keep moving in the right direction.

    In my free time I like to play games, rock climb and read.
