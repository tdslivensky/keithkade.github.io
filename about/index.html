    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>
    I am a computer scientist in my senior year at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, TX. I'm specializing in Human Computer Interaction, Information Visualization, and Front-End development. I research at the Interface Ecology lab, where we develop next gen human/computer interfaces.

    In addition to computers, I'm into politics, golf, and comic books. I make art sometimes, and upload my work for class to their respective pages under "classes."
