                        <span class="thoughts">When someone my age asks me to recommend a book about God, this is what I will give them. </span>
                    </li>
                    <li>The Match<br/>
                        <span class="thoughts">Gets a little lost in the details, but a great history lesson on the pro/amatuer divide unknown by many modern golfers. </span>
                    </li>
                    <li>The Martian <br/>
                        <span class="thoughts">Written by a nerd for nerds. Now I want to see the movie. </span>

                    <li>Bleach <br/>
                        <span class="thoughts">Well it's finally over. Been reading since highschool, and I can't help but wonder if it was cancelled - based on how rushed the ending was. </span>

                        <span class="thoughts">I'm a fan of McClaren's prose as well as his practical theology. He argues for a Christianity and the church evolve to embrace and minster to an increasingly postmodern world.</span>
                    </li>  
                    <li>Dune <br/> 
                        <span class="thoughts">In spite of how long ago the story was written, I knew little about it. Herbert's universe fascinated me more than any other in recent memory. Unfortunately it shows its age with some sexism and homophobia.</span>

                    <li>The Dark Tower Series <br/> 
                        <span class="thoughts">Read over the span of 4 years. Compelling throughout, but the shines most in the end.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>Treasure Island <br/> 
                        <span class="thoughts">Recieved a nifty leather version as a gift. Great to revisit a story from childhood.</span>

                        <span class="thoughts">A little weak at first, but has a fulfilling conclusion. </span>
                    </li>  
                    <li>Final Fantasy Tactics (WotL) (iPhone)<br/>
                        <span class="thoughts">Whew. Fun, but not suited for iPhone. </span>
                    </li>  
                    <li>Xenogears<br/>
                        <span class="thoughts">I gave up about a third of the way through. Interesting characters and story, but awful combat. </span>
                    </li>  
                    <li>Final Fantasy 5 (iPhone)<br/>
                        <span class="thoughts">Delightful remake. This was the only classic (2d) Final Fantasy I had yet to play, and it's wonderful job system is deserving of the praise it receives. </span>
                    </li>  
                    <li>Gauntlet Legends<br/>
                        <span class="thoughts">Tons of fun to play back through this with a friend. Gameplay definitely felt archaic at times though (dang those switches).</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>Hearthstone<br/>
                        <span class="thoughts">Great game that provided me tons of entertainment, but with school I didn't have the time to play enough to enjoy it.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>Final Fantasy Brave Exvius<br/>
                        <span class="thoughts">Well made and I was briefly sucked in pretty deep, but I'm making an effort to not let things this shallow absorb so much of my time. So I deleted it. </span>
                    </li>
                    <li>Monument Valley<br/>
                        <span class="thoughts">Zen.</span>

                        <span class="thoughts">This game had me programming a Fibonacci sequence in assembly - for fun. Full of character, but not sure if a non-programmer would have as much fun as I did.</span>
                    </li>   
                    <li>Chrono Trigger <br/> 
                        <span class="thoughts">Completely deserving of the praise it so often receives.</span>

                    <li>Donkey Kong 64 <br/> 
                        <span class="thoughts">Ugh. As fun as I remember in parts, but plagued by some glaring design issues. See my blog <a href="/2016/06/07/dk64.html">rant.</a></span>

                    <li>Divinity Original Sin <br/> 
                        <span class="thoughts">Co-op done right. True to its tabletop roots without letting them bog gameplay down. Story wasn't particularly memorable, but the gameplay made up for it.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>Terraria <br/> 
                        <span class="thoughts">Played as couch co-op on PS4. Really a blast, but the experience would have been better on PC.</span>
